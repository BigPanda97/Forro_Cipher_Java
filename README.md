# Forro_Cipher_Java
> \[!CAUTION]
> 1. ⚠️ [Forró](https://iacr.org/cryptodb/data/paper.php?pubkey=32422) is a relatively new algorithm, a stream cipher which is similar to Salsa and ChaCha, but with faster diffusion. It has been proposed at [Asiacrypt 2022](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-22963-3_9). Although it is based on ChaCha20, a thoroughly analyzed algorithm, Forró is still not "battle tested".
> 2. ⚠️ This repository contains a Java version of Forró and XForró which have been translated from C, C#, and Zig source-code using ChatGPT-o3. So be careful, although it seems to pass all the official and unofficial test-vectors.
